          <p><strong>I'm a computer consultant</strong> and have been for 25 years. I will perfectly understand what you need your computer to do, based on our discussions.</p>

              tell you how effective each one is and inform you of all costs. You decide and I execute. It's that simple. 
              You're in control of all decisions as we put systems and software into place.</p>

          <p>You can go to any computer consultant for this kind of help. Then again, how many of them truly understand your
