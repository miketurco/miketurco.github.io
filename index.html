          <p><strong>You're a businessman.</strong> Above all, you're good at running your business. Odds are you can't or don't want to setup, program and organize the computers yourself. 
              At the same time, there are more things you need your computers to do so that you can grow your business.</p>

          <p><strong>I'm a computer consultant</strong> and have been for 25 years. I will perfectly understand what you need your computer to do, based on our discussions.</p>

          <h3 class="w3-text-grey">Here's how can help</h3>
          <p>I will give you the best business software and systems advice I can. Specifically, I will lay out your options, 
              tell you how effective each one is and inform you of all costs. You decide and I execute. It's that simple. 
              You're in control of all decisions as we put systems and software into place.</p>

          <p>You can go to any computer consultant for this kind of help. Then again, how many of them truly understand your 
              profession and specific business needs? I do. Give me a call for a free initial consultation.</p>
